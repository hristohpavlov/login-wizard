To run this project, you have to start the backend server and start the frontend.
In order for it to work with the firebase account already set up, please make sure to paste the .env files in the proper directories. Those will be provided in the email.

## If the .evn files are not located in the proper directory, auth and connection with firebase will fail.

The .env files received in the email submission will be called .env(fe) and .env(be).
Please put each one in the proper directory (example .env(fe) should be put in ./frontend/)
After the .env is in the directory, please rename it (example .env(fe) should be renamed to .env)
